# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System â€“ Phase 3: Two-Tower Neural Network

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This branch implements a movie recommendation system utilizing a Two-Tower Neural Network architecture. The system efficiently handles large-scale datasets and provides personalized movie recommendations by learning user and item embeddings separately, leveraging vector similarity search directly within the database using the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for PostgreSQL.


## ðŸ§  Phase 3: Two-Tower Neural Network Based Recommendation

The Two-Tower Neural Network (TTNN) is a deep learning architecture designed to generate personalized recommendations by independently learning dense vector representations (embeddings) for users and items. Unlike the Factorization Machines model in Phase 2, which relied on linear interactions, this model leverages neural networks and vector similarity to capture more complex patterns in user behavior. Once we generate the vector space we use similarity search to find the recommended movies for each user. A Flask API serves recommendations to end users.

The two-tower model consists of two neural networks (towers):

- User Tower
- Item Tower

Each tower calculates a vector embedding for its respective domain using the same number of dimensions. The model is trained using [triplet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_loss), which encourages user embeddings to be closer to positive (liked) items and farther from negative (disliked or unwatched) ones in the embedding space. The similarity between user and item embeddings is computed to predict user preferences.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Characteristics:

- **Personalization:**  Learns separate embedding spaces for users and items, enabling highly tailored recommendations

- **Scalability:**  Precomputing and storing embeddings in the database allows fast and scalable inference via vector similarity

- **Ranking-Aware Evaluation:** Performance is evaluated using the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ([NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain)) metric to ensure quality of ranked lists

- **Cold Start Handling:**  If the user is not found in the embedding table, the system falls back to the popularity-based recommendations from Phase 1

- **End-to-End Workflow:**  Integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, embedding storage, and deployment through Airflow, Docker and Flask

## ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline Workflow
The data pipeline is orchestrated using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and automates the following steps:

- **Data Ingestion:** The DAG is scheduled to periodically ingest new user-movie rating data into the PostgreSQL database

- **Model Training:** The [train.py](./train.py) script is triggered to train the Two-Tower Neural Network. It learns separate embeddings for users and movies

- **Embedding Storage:** After training, user and movie embeddings are stored in the PostgreSQL database using the pgvector extension to support fast similarity search

- **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using the NDCG metric to assess recommendation ranking quality. Metrics are saved to the `model_metrics` table

- **Model Comparison and Update:**

    - The best score is stored in the `best_score` table

    - After each run, the latest score is compared against the best score to determine whether to update the stored embeddings

    - If the current model outperforms the previous one, the embeddings in the database are updated for serving live recommendations
