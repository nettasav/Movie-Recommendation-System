# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System â€“ Phase 2: Factorization Machines
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This repository showcases a modular and extensible framework for building movie recommendation engines. Each branch represents a distinct recommendation strategy. This *Phase 2 - Factorization Machines* branch focuses on a Factorization Machines (FMs)-based recommendation approach, designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## ðŸ§  Phase 2: Factorization Machines Based Recommendation
[Factorization Machines (FMs)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5694074) is a powerful model for capturing interactions between variables in sparse datasets. Unlike the baseline model in Phase 1, which provided the same recommendations to all users, this phase captures user-item interactions to tailor suggestions to individual preferences. The entire workflow is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, with data stored in a PostgreSQL database. A **Flask API** serves the recommendations to end-users.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Personalization:** Learns user-specific preferences for improved recommendations
- **Scalability:** Efficient training via Mini-Batch Gradient Descent enables handling large datasets
- **Ranking-Aware Evaluation:** Uses **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)** to measure the quality of ranked recommendations
- **Cold start:** In case a new user asked for prediction, since we do not have any data on them we can't use the FM model, we return an answer based on the popularity prediction from phase 1 
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Incorporates automated data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment via **Airflow** and **Docker**


## ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline Workflow
The data pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow** and follows these steps:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Airflow DAGs are scheduled to ingest new user-movie rating data into the PostgreSQL database
2. **Model Training:** The fm_model_MBGD.py script is triggered to train the FM model using MBGD
3. **Model Evaluation** Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated using the NDCG metric to assess the quality of recommendations
  - The metrics are saves to the `model_metrics` table 
4. **Model Comparison And Update:**
  - The best score is saved separatly and after each run the current metric is compared to the best score to determine if this iteration of the model should replace the previous one
  - If the model is determined to be better, we run the prediction on the entire dataset and save the results to `predicted_ratings' table for serving

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nettasav/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
git checkout phase2-factorization-machines
```

2. **Build and start the containers:**
```bash

docker-compose up --build
```

3. **Access the services:**
- **Airflow UI:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- **API Endpoint:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)


## ðŸ“ˆ API Usage
Once the API is running, you can access the FM-based recommendations:

- **Endpoint:** 
```bash
http://localhost:5000/recommend/fm?user_id=<USER_ID>
```

- **Description:** Returns top 5 recommended movie titles for a given user
- **Query Parameter:** `user_id` (integer): The ID of the user to generate recommendations for
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Example Request:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/recommend/fm?user_id=123"
```

- **Example Response:**
```json
[
  "The Shawshank Redemption",
  "Forrest Gump",
  "Inception",
  "The Dark Knight",
  "Pulp Fiction"
  ]

```
