# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System â€“ Phase 1: Popularity-Based Model
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This repository showcases a modular and extensible framework for building movie recommendation engines. Each branch represents a distinct recommendation strategy. This phase1-popularity branch focuses on a popularity-based recommendation approach, serving as a foundational baseline for more advanced models.

## ðŸ§  Phase 1: Popularity-Based Recommendation
In this initial phase, the system recommends movies that are popular among the general audience. This approach does not require user-specific data, making it ideal for new users or as a baseline for comparison with more personalized methods.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and interpret
- **No Personalization:** Recommendations are the same for all users
- **Baseline Benchmark:** Serves as a reference point to evaluate more complex models

## ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline Workflow
The data pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow and follows these steps:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Fetches movie data from external sources or local files
2. **Feature Engineering:** Calculates popularity metrics (e.g., average rating, rating count)
3. **Data Storage: Stores** the processed data in a structured format for quick retrieval


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nettasav/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
git checkout phase1-popularity
```

2. **Build and start the containers:**
```bash

docker-compose up --build
```

3. **Access the services:**
- **Airflow UI:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **API Endpoint:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


## ðŸ“ˆ API Usage
Once the API is running, you can access the popularity-based recommendations:

- **Endpoint:** `/recommend/popular`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Response:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {"title": "Movie A", "average_rating": 4.5},
